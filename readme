This is a basic tool that I needed for a project on my website.

It loops over a folder and converts all .HEIC (iphone pics) into .jpg format while keeping metadata intact

To use it,

1. Download the repo

2. open a terminal window in the folder

3. run "npm install"

4. either change the file path to your desired one or place all of your pictures in ./putPicsHere

5. run "local-converter.js"

6. enjoy your .jpg pics
